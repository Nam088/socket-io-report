- Connections: total, per-namespace
- Messages: expected vs received, per-batch coverage

## üß™ Test cases {#test-cases}

Use the benchmark CLI to drive scenarios; reports are generated alongside.

## üö© Suspicious Signals Summary

- Only the first broadcast batch delivers (~1.3k msgs); subsequent batches drop to near 0% at 5k, 9k, and ~10k (capped 9,990).
- Cumulative received stalls around 1,296‚Äì1,297 shortly after reaching target actives, even while connections remain high initially.
- After reaching target, active connections decay over time (e.g., 9k ‚Üí 8k ‚Üí 6k ‚Üí 4k ‚Üí ~1.3k ‚Üí ~100) indicating retention/timeouts/back‚Äëpressure effects.
- CPU peaks low-to-moderate (0.0377‚Äì0.106 cores) while memory rises (182‚Äì450+ MiB), suggesting bottleneck is not CPU but I/O/queueing/policy.
- Istio sidecar present (added hop/latency and memory) across runs.
