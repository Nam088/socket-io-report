```

## ğŸ“ˆ Metrics collected

- RAM: rss, heapUsed, heapTotal, external, arrayBuffers
- CPU: peak, average (interval-based)
- Connections: total, per-namespace
- Messages: expected vs received, per-batch coverage

## ğŸ§ª Test cases

Use the benchmark CLI to drive scenarios; reports are generated alongside.

```bash
npm run test:10k
npm run test:20k
```
